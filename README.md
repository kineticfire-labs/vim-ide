# vim-ide
Use vim as an IDE!

# Purpose
vim-ide provides a unified IDE experience.  vim-ide takes an opinionated approach of defining intuitive shortcuts for frequently-used commands and adding only necessary functionality by curating and integrating vim plugins, all without clobbering native vim settings that you already know.  That means less time configuring your IDE, and more time toward productive coding.

vim-ide defines these goals:
1. Setup vim as an IDE for a variety of langauges with emphasis on Java and Clojure
2. Define a portable vim configuration for familiar vim interaction on environments where IDE functionality isn't necessary
